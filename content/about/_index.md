Hello, I'm Jacquie Grindrod :coffee:

Growing up in rural North Western Ontario was an adventure framed by hills, lakes and trees. 

I've been in DevOps for ~5 years across FinTech, media & Digital Health companies. I'm passionate about solving problems with a holistic approach, and bridging the gaps in people, communication and systems. Building something meaningful is important to me - from making healthcare accessible to creating a networking app for women in tech (winning team at ElleHacks 2018). I recently became one of Canada's Top 30 Under 30 Developers and was a first time speaker at DevOpsDays Toronto - 2019!

Pushing through my fears is a core part of who I am.
* I'm scared of heights :scream: so I went cliff jumping, climbing & rappelled down a 30 meter cliff!
* I used to be shy in meetings :fire: so I dove into Lunch & Learns and spoke at a conference in front of ~1,000 people.
* Pair programming :eyes: Now I'm learning a new language while streaming on twitch where anyone can drop in!

Just to name a few, although I didn't make it through these alone. I strongly believe that through community & support we can reach greater heights than previously imagined :rocket:
