# Project Log - Sun. Dec 8th, 2019
## Goals
* Airport Coding!
  * Review Mentor Feedback on Two-Fer & Hamming exercises
  * Do as much of the feedback as I can while I wait for my boarding time

### Exercism Review  
* Removed redundant variable in Two-Fer exercise
* There's a short list of things to do for Hamming.

### Resources - Exercism Exercises
* On Strings & Runes in Go
  * https://blog.golang.org/strings
* How to write idiomatic Go & make best of various Go features  
  * https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html
* On Naming Errors & returning 0
  * https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments#error-strings
  * https://golang.org/ref/spec#The_zero_value

### Lessons Learned/Thoughts
* Hitting my head on Strings vs Runes.
  * After I grasp it better, could be a good candidate for a short blog/video to help others having same learning curve speedbump.
